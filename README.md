## CITeTOURS

CITeTOURS is a digital personal tour guide that can give you the history and information of any nearby landmark to a distance of the users choice. The user can then choose if they would like the information read to them by Cindy the CITeTOURS tour guide or whether to read it themselves.

The app utilises React Native geolocation along with wikipedia api's and expo TTS to locate the nearby landmarks and deliver its information.
